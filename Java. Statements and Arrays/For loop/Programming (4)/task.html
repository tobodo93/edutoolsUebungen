  <p><b>Arithmetic average</b></p> 
  <p>Write a program that reads two numbers <span class="math-tex">\( a \)</span> and <span class="math-tex">\( b \)</span> from the keyboard, calculates and outputs to the console the arithmetic average of all numbers from the interval <span class="math-tex">\( [a; b] \)</span>, which are divided by <span class="math-tex">\( 3 \)</span>.</p> 
  <p>In the example below the arithmetic average is calculated for the numbers on the interval <span class="math-tex">\( [-5; 12] \)</span>. Total numbers divided by <span class="math-tex">\( 3 \)</span> on this interval <span class="math-tex">\( 6 \)</span>: <span class="math-tex">\( -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 \)</span>. Their arithmetic average equals to <span class="math-tex">\( 4.5 \)</span> </p> 
  <p>The program input contains intervals, which always contain at least one number, which is divided by <span class="math-tex">\( 3 \)</span>.</p>
