  <p>Upon learning that DNA is not a random string, freshmen of the Bioinformatics Institute from the informatics group suggested using a compression algorithm that compresses repeated characters in a string.<br></p> 
  <p>Encoding is performed as follows:<br>The string <b>"aaaabbсaa"</b> is converted into <b>"a4b2с1a2"</b>, that is, the groups of the same characters of the input string are replaced by the symbol and the number of its repetitions in this string.</p> 
  <p>Write a program, which reads the string, encodes it by this algorithm and outputs the encoded sequence. The encoding must <b></b>be<b></b> case sensitive.</p>
