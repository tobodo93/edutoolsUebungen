  <p>Given a year, find out if it is a leap year.<br></p> 
  <p>As a reminder, leap years are those divisible by 4 but not by 100, as well as those divisible by 400. For example, 2000 was a leap year, but 2100 will be a regular year. </p>
  <p>The program should work correctly for years 1900 ≤ n ≤ 3000.</p>
  <p>Output <b>Leap</b> (case-sensitive) if the given year is a leap year, and <b>Regular </b>otherwise.</p>
